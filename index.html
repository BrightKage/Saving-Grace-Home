        <h2>About My Project</h2>
      <p>My Project is a paper about "Dog Stigmas" and sterotypes, it shows that the stigma of dogs being like Pitbull's being aggresive has no foundation. For my product i decided to volunteer at the dog shelter were i got my dog and make a website based on my experiences. I have volunteered for 7 hours and counting, it have played with lots of dogs and not once seen any of the Pitbulls as agrresive normally the small dogs would be the more "Aggresive" dogs even though they would just play around and not cause any real problems.</p>
